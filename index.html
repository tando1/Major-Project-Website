        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Engaging in regular physical activity, particularly gym-based exercises, 
            is one of the most effective ways to improve both physical and mental health. 
            Strength training, cardio workouts, and flexibility exercises offer a wide range of benefits, 
            from building muscle and enhancing cardiovascular health to boosting energy levels and improving mood. 
        </p>
        <p>Consistent gym workouts help regulate weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart conditions, 
            and promote better sleep patterns. Beyond the physical benefits, exercise also plays a crucial role in mental 
            wellbeing by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression while improving cognitive function and self-esteem. 
            This comprehensive approach to fitness ensures that a regular gym routine not only strengthens the body 
            but also nurtures the mind, leading to an overall improvement in quality of life

        <h2>Health Benefits by Exercise Type</h2>
        <div class="accordion">
            <h3>Cardio Exercises</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Cardio exercises are considered some of the best forms of exercise for building overall heart health and stamina. 
                    Certain common forms of aerobic workouts include running, cycling and swimming. 
                    These raise the rate at which your heart pumps blood and increase lung function, improving cardiovascular endurance. 
                    In the process of regularly performing cardio workouts, the risks associated with heart diseases are reduced; blood pressure is put under control, and the capacity of the lungs is increased. 
                    Besides that, cardio is among the best methods of burning calories and losing weight. 
                    This, in turn, will widen their metabolic condition and reduce the risk of diseases such as diabetes. 
                    These forms of workouts improve mental well-being since these chemical substances released by the brain tend to improve a person's mood. 
                    These are endorphins, which lower cases of stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Strength Training</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Strength training, otherwise known as resistance training, includes activities that have the element of muscle strength and endurance-
                    for example, weight training, bodyweight exercises, or resistance bands. 
                    Regular strength training strengthens the musculature tone, strengthens bone density, and improves joint functionality to prevent injury and reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life. 
                    It increases metabolism because lean muscle mass will indeed burn more calories, even at rest. 
                    Besides, strength training advances posture, balance, and coordination and thus enhances the building of better functional strength in daily activities. 
                    Other mental benefits include increased confidence, resilience, and better focus.</p>
